test vpnbox and deployment

issue:
when vpnbox-bar was set up and vpnbox-foo shut down, r2d2 did not connect
to -bar

procedure:

make release branch
# ideally promote branch before testing on new stage
#deploy futel-stage
#promote to futel-prod

deploy vpnbox-prod-baz
deploy vpnbox-prod-qux
deploy futel-stage
edit /vagrant/src/iptables.sh on futel-stage to use -baz and -qux && service iptables restart
edit router to use -baz and -qux and reboot
set up sip device for futel-stage ext 671

test failover:
connected to baz?
stop -baz
connected to qux?
start -baz, stop -qux
connected to baz?
start -qux, stop -baz
connected to qux?

test failover when original client does not connect:
reboot router
connected to qux?
start -baz, stop -qux
connected to baz

test failover when ip address for name changes:
start -baz, -qux
reboot router
connected to baz?
stop -baz
connected to qux?
deploy vpnbox-prod-quux
edit dns to point -baz to -quux, wait for propagation
stop -qux
perform iptables update on futel-stage as for vpnbox promotion
connected to baz (quux)?
start -qux, stop -baz
connected to qux?

stop -baz, -qux, -quux
stop futel-stage

edit router to use -foo and -bar and reboot
edit sip device to use futel-prod ext 671
test
destroy -baz, -qux, -quux

deploy vpnbox-prod-bar
test
stop vpnbox-prod-foo, test
XXX r2d2 will lose service while vpnbox-prod-foo is down
start vpnbox-prod-foo, test
verify that prod clients are connected
disconnect router, sip device

destroy futel-stage

# if not already done
#deploy futel-stage
#promote to futel-prod

edit sip device to use futel-prod ext 670
swap router and sip device at r2d2
