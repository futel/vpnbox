# (cert), and private key (key).  Each client
# and the server must have their own cert and
# key file.  The server and all clients will
# use the same ca file.

# See the "easy-rsa" directory for a series
# of scripts for generating RSA certificates
# and private keys.  Remember to use
# a unique Common Name for the server

# The server will take 10.8.0.1 for itself,

# on 10.8.0.1. Comment this line out if you are
# ethernet bridging. See the man page for more info.

# know to reach their gateway (.1) and LAN (.0) without using the VPN.
